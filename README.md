# LISP Repository

### Solutions to Project Euler problems
This repository contains my solutions to [Project Euler](http://www.projecteuler.net) problems. Most solutions are in separate `.lisp` files.
The filenames says which solution(s) each file contains.

Some solutions are calculated by a single closure; in others, a function needs to be invoked from the Lisp command line. A few of the files are accompanied by a brief description of how the solution works.

No actual results are shown so as not to spoil the fun. Please don't use my code to cheat.

In addition to Project Euler problems, this repository contains some solutions to miscellaneous problems.
